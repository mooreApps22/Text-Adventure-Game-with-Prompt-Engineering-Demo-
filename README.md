This a demo for a text adventure game that runs in the shell and uses the Anthropic API. 

The game allows you to pick any period, group of people, start location, and destination and it will simulate what it was like for that group of people to migrate to a new place. 

The execution of this program requires an active Anthropic API account and cost factions of a penny to for each function call to the API.
